# Curseforge Modpack Downloader
Tool for automated downloading of Minecraft modpacks from CurseForge.

Made for my fellow pirate niggas. Relies on unofficial API accidentally found on some sketchy website so don't be surprised if it stops working one day.

# Usage
0. `pip3 install aiohttp`
1. download zip archive from modpack page, unzip it, acquire `manifest.json`
2. `python3 download.py -m path/to/manifest.json -o path/to/mods/`
3. apply overloads from modpack zip
4. ???
5. PROFIT
